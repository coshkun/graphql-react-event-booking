# graphql-react-event-booking
A pure event booking API project written by GraphQL api querying language. This server will have a react-native based front end project soon to interact with the queries. i've started this project to learn GraphQL but it is pretty easy and useful. then i decided to create this repo as a boilerplate code-base for my future evet/booking based applications.
